# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains CI/CD workflow files for automated testing and deployment.

## Workflow Files to Create

Based on `GITHUB-DEPLOY.md`, create these workflow files:

1. **ci.yml** - Run tests on every push/PR
2. **deploy-production.yml** - Automated deployment to production
3. **deploy-manual.yml** - Manual deployment with approval
4. **health-check.yml** - Daily health checks
5. **backup.yml** - Automated database backups

## Getting Started

1. Read `GITHUB-DEPLOY.md` for complete setup instructions
2. Configure GitHub Secrets (see GITHUB-DEPLOY.md Step 3)
3. Copy workflow examples from GITHUB-DEPLOY.md to this directory
4. Test workflows before enabling automatic deployment

## Directory Structure

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    ├── ci.yml
    ├── deploy-production.yml
    ├── deploy-manual.yml
    ├── health-check.yml
    └── backup.yml
```

## Important Notes

- Always test workflows on a staging environment first
- Never commit secrets to workflow files
- Use GitHub Secrets for all sensitive data
- Set up environment protection for production deployments

For detailed instructions, see: `GITHUB-DEPLOY.md`
